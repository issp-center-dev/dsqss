Definition of models and lattices of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg dimers by standard mode of DSQSS/DLA
===============================================================

In this tutorial, we will consider a system in which an external magnetic field is applied to a :math:`S=1/2` antiferromagnetic Heisenberg dimer :math:`\mathcal{H}= \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}-J_z S^z_i S^z_j -\frac{J_{xy}}{2}(S^+_i S^-_j +S^-_i S^+_j)-h\sum_i S^z_i ,~J_z<0, J_xy<0, h>0`
by calculating the approximate form of the lattice,
you learn how to use the standard mode of DSQSS/DLA.

The calculations in the standard mode of DSQSS/DLA are as follows

1. prepare an input file for simple mode,
2. create an input file for standard mode,
3. run the calculation.



Preparing the input file for simple mode
********************

To run DSQSS/DLA, you will need the simple mode file std.toml in TOML format with the following information

#. Hamiltonian Information,
#. Information on lattices,
#. Information on parameters such as inverse temperature and number of Monte Carlo steps.

Thus, the first step is to prepare this input file.
The file of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg dimer is available in the following location
(sample/dla/01_spindimer/std.toml)
::

   [hamiltonian]
   model = "spin"
   M =  1                 # S=1/2
   Jz = -1.0              # coupling constant, negative for AF
   Jxy = -1.0             # coupling constant, negative for AF
   h = 0.0                # magnetic field
   [lattice]
   lattice = "hypercubic" # hypercubic, periodic
   dim = 1                # dimension
   L = 2                  # number of sites along each direction
   bc = false             # open boundary
   [parameter]
   beta = 100             # inverse temperature
   nset = 5               # set of Monte Carlo sweeps
   npre = 10              # MCSteps to estimate hyperparameter
   ntherm = 10            # MCSweeps for thermalization
   nmcs = 100             # MCSweeps for measurement
   seed = 31415           # seed of RNG

To this file, we add the effect of applying an external magnetic field in the z direction,
and set the lattice dimension and the number of sites to 2 and 4, respectively

   M =  1                 # S=1/2
   Jz = -1.0              # coupling constant, negative for AF
   Jxy = -1.0             # coupling constant, negative for AF
   h = 0.5                # magnetic field

Writing an input file for standard mode
**********

This file is given to dla_hamgen
::

  $ dla_hamgen std.toml

As a result, a text file in TOML format, hamiltonian.toml, 
is generated to describe the information of the site Hamiltonian and the many-body interaction.


Next, you give std.toml to dla_latgen
::

  $ dla_latgen -t lattice.toml std.toml


As a result, a text file in TOML format, lattice.toml, 
is generated to describe the information of the space using unit cells and basic translation vectors.


Running the calculation
****************

With lattice.toml as input file, you can create a gnuplot file lattice.plt::
::

  $ dla_latgen -g lattice.plt lattice.toml

Giving lattce.plt to gnuplot will produce a two-dimensional schematic of the lattice::


.. figure:: ../../../image/dla/tutorial/2Dlattice.png
  :name: fig_2Dlattice
  :alt: Two-dimensional lattice

 Schematic of the lattice of an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain in an external magnetic field in the z direction.
  
  
  
Writing lattice.dat and kpoints.dat
********************

The lattice.toml file defines the lattice information using unit cells and fundamental translation vectors, 
while the lattice.dat file defines the lattice information using the number of sites and interactions between sites. 
The lattice.dat file also can be generated using the simple mode file std.toml in TOML format.
You give std.toml to dla_latgen, which contains the effect of applying an external magnetic field in the z direction as used earlier
::

  $ dla_latgen -o lattice.dat std.toml 

As a result, you will get the lattice.dat file as follows

Next, you can create kpoints.dat, 
which is a text file that specifies the coefficients of the reciprocal grid vector expansion of the wavenumber vector.
You can specify the size by using -s. Please give the std.toml file to dla_wvgen -s ::

  $ dla_wvgen -s "8 8" std.toml 

As a result, you will get the following kpoints.dat file
::

   dim

   kpoints

   0 0 0
   1 0 4
   2 4 0
