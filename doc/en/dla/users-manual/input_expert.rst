- About simulationtime

  - When simulationtime > 0.0

    - DSQSS/DLA loads the checkpoint file and resumes the simulation if the checkpoint file exists.
        - If not, DSQSS/DLA starts a new simulation.
    - After the time specified by "simulationtime" (in seconds) has elapsed, DSQSS/DLA saves the state of the simulation into the checkpoint file and halts the simulation.
    - The name of the checkpoint file is that of the main result file with a suffix ".cjob".

  - When simulationtime <= 0.0

    - The checkpoint file is ignored. DSQSS/DLA never saves nor loads it.



.. _lattice_xml_file:

Lattice XML file ``lattice.xml``
**************************************

A lattice file is a textfile written in XML format.
This defines space to be simulation, for example, the number of sites, the connections between sites, and so on.
This file can be very complicated, so DSQSS has a utility tool ``dla_alg`` to generate lattice XML files from simpler files, lattice data files and lattice TOML files.

The lattice file has a unique element named "Lattice". The other elements belong to "Lattice" as children.

  This takes integers as many as :math:`2\times` "Algorithm/Interaction/NBody" and one preceding floating number.
  The integers denote the states of sites before and after applying the local Hamiltonian.
  The last floating number represents the sign.
  If the sign is equal to :math:`1.0`:, this element (``<Sign> ... </Sign>``) can be omitted.

  For example, ``<Sign> 0 1 1 0 -1.0 </Sign>`` means :math:`\langle 1 0 | \left(-\mathcal{H}\right) | 0 1 \rangle < 0`.

 This example represents the following scenario;

  - Initial states of bottom-left(0), top-left(0), bottom-right(2), and top-right(3) are 1, 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
  - A worm head comes from bottom-left(0) and changes the state of this leg to 0.
  - The worm head will be scattered to leg(3) and the state of outgoing leg will be changed to 0 with the probability 1.

Algorithm/Vertex/InitialConfiguration/State
  The initial states of the legs of the vertex.
  Since the number of the legs is as twice as the number specified by "Algorithm/Vertex/NBody", say :math:`m`,
  this takes :math:`2m` integers.
  Legs are in the same order as the corresponding sites.
  For two legs on the same site, the leg with the smaller imaginary time comes first.

Algorithm/Vertex/InitialConfiguration/IncomingDirection
  The index of the leg from which a worm head comes.

Algorithm/Vertex/InitialConfiguration/NewState

Algorithm/Vertex/InitialConfiguration/Channel

  This takes two integers and one floating number.

  - First figure denotes the **index** of the leg where the scattered worm head goes out.
  - Second figure denotes the **state** of the leg where the scattered worm head goes out after the scattering.
  - Last figure denotes the probability of this channel.

  For the special case, the pair-annihilation of worm heads, let both the first and the second integer be -1.
