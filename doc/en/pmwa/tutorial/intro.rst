About DSQSS/PMWA
---------------------------
``DSQSS / PMWA`` is a numerical package of the world-line quantum Monte Carlo method with non-local updates algorithm for large-scale parallel computing. PMWA can treat :math:`S=1/2` quantum many-body system such as XXZ spin model, Heisenberg model, transverse Ising model and hard-core boson system with large lattice sizes at finite temperatures. Basically, any physical quantities can be calculated within the statistical error. By default, the energy under a longitudinal worm source field, longitudinal magnetization, transverse magnetization, winding number, and imaginary time :math:`S^z S^z` spin correlation function are calculated.
